# Stock-Market-Price-Prediction
As algorithmic and high frequency trading is key technology that would be used for passive investing as markets become efficient in the upcoming future. 

So here we try to predict prices of GOOGLE stock using 
sequential LSTM which is a part of a deep learning model.

Some alternatives that we could have used which can also be used to predict prices are
- XGBoost 
- adaboost
- RandomForest
- Regression


Libraries used to conduct or carry out this project are
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Sklearn
- Keras

This has been done in three stage
1) Data Preprocessing
2) Initialising and training RNN
3) Predicitng the stock prices
